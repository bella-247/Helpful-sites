Site that stores your favorite sites with dynamic searching function on it.


🌐 Tired of losing track of your favorite websites? 🌐

I used to store all my must-visit sites in a simple text file—until I realized how cumbersome it was to manage. Finding the right URL among a sea of text, copying and pasting into a browser, and dealing with the limitations of browser shortcuts made the whole process a hassle.

So, I decided to revolutionize my web management with a custom-built website designed just for this purpose! 🚀

Introducing my new site: a personal bookmark manager with a twist. Here’s what makes it stand out:

Easy Access: Save your favorite websites and access them quickly with a single click.
Seamless Editing: Update URLs or site names effortlessly whenever needed.
Smart Search: Instantly find what you're looking for with a powerful search function that filters as you type.
Intuitive Design: A clean, user-friendly interface that puts your bookmarks at your fingertips.
I've created a video showcasing how this site transforms the way I manage and access my favorite links.

👀 Watch the demo video and see the magic in action. Then, head over to the public GitHub repository to explore the code, and maybe even build your own version!
